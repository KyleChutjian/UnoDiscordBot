## Playing Uno
- To start a game, one player has to type "**.start**". This will have an embedded message show up, with three buttons. 
- 2-6 players can join the game by clicking the blue "Join" button.
- When all players are in the game, one player can click the green "Start" button to start the game. All players will get a direct message of their hand.
- It will say who's turn it is in the channel, and that player can type "**.play card1**", to play the first card in their hand.
- When a player has two cards left on their turn, they can type "**.uno**" before playing their second to last card. If they don't, then a player can type "**.uno**" in the Discord channel so that player receives 2 extra cards.
- When a player runs out of cards, they are declared the winner and the game stops!
